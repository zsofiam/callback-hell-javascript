# Callback Hell

## Story

We have a huge problem, the Callback Hell of JavaScript has opened up and it is threatening the developer world with total destruction! We can already see the Pyramid of Doom down there, so this is no joke. You have to pick up some explosives and blow the whole thing out of existence to save our precious world (and StackOverflow)!

The task is easy, you need to deploy a bomb and notify others when it is going to blow up.
You can communicate through a website with a terminal-like view
and update it with the counting down in real time: "3... 2... 1... Boom!"

## What are you going to learn?

Execution flow in JavaScript is different from most languages so we'll check out some of its essential features to understand it better:

- how to structure JavaScript code and make sense of callbacks when using `setTimeout` and event handlers
- the event driven nature of JavaScript
- that functions can be passed inside other functions as arguments
- JavaScript Promise basics

## Tasks

1. Implement real time countdown by using `setTimeout()` and callbacks
    - The countdown sequence shows up in real time:
  - print "The bomb goes off in..."
  - wait 1s
  - print "3..."
  - wait 1s
  - print "2..."
  - wait 1s
  - print "1..."
  - wait 1s
  - print "Boom!"

2. [OPTIONAL] Implement the same task, but this time use JavaScript Promises
    - The countdown sequence shows up in real time, and the execution flow is controlled by Promises.

## General requirements

- Only `printText()` and `clear()` from `common.js` are used for DOM manipulation.

## Hints

- You can open the `index.html` by starting a small HTTP server
(see the background materials for details)
